<ul>
  <li>Why are there diminishing returns at higher concurrency levels?</li>
</ul>
  <p>We can observe from -c 32 and above the average request stopped doubling. I think the reason is that although mutiple requests are sent at a time, the github page has a limited processing time for each request. Hence the maximum processing time is about 180~ [#/sec] regardless the number of request recieved. </p>
<ul>
  <li>What’s the performance difference when requesting HTTP and HTTPS?</li>

  </table>

  <p>I think because HTTP saved the SSL processing time, HTTP has higher average #/sec request than HTTPS  </p>


<ul>
  <li>How can github respond so quickly?</li>
</ul>

  <p>Load Balancer, Cache, RPC call to smoke, Redis/MySQL</p>
